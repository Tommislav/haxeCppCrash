I get instant crash when trying to compile my entity engine to cpp and android.
After several late nights I've managed to get down to the very core of whats causing the
crash. I am quite new at haxe, and have very basic skills in c++ and need help if this
issue is a bug in the haxe cpp code generation or if I'm doing something wrong.
